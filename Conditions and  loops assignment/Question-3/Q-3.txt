Q3. What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and
examples.
=> Loops are used to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. A loop will continue running until the defined 
   condition returns false. Loops provide a quick and easy method of doing something repeatedly. They are used to
   repeat an action number of times without leaving to repeat the same line of code.

   There are different types of loops:
   1. for loop- A for loop repeats until a specified condition revaluates to false.
       
       Syntax- for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement){
                 // statement
                } 
       Example- for(let a= 1; i<=10; i++){
                  console.log(a);
                }
      
   2. While-loop- A while loop statement executes its statements until a specified condition evaluates to true.
    
      Syntax- while(condition){
                 // statement
               }
      Example-  let i= 5;
                while(i>0){
                  console.log(i);
                  i++;
                }

   3. do-while loop- The do-while loop statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.

       Syntax- do 
                // statement
                 while(condition);
         
       Example- let a=0;
                do{
                  a++;
                  console.log(a);
                }(a<10);
