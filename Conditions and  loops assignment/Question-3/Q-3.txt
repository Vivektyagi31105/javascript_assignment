Q3. What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and
examples.
=> Loops are used to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. A loop will continue running until the defined 
   condition returns false. Loops provide a quick and easy method of doing something repeatedly. They are used to
   repeat an action number of times without leaving to repeat the same line of code.
