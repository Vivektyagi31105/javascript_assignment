1.What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples.

=> Conditional statements in javascript allow you to execute specific blocks of code based on conditions. If the
   condition meets then a particular block of action will be executed otherwise it will be executed otherwise
   it will execute another block of action that satisfies particular condition.

   Conditional statements in js-

   1. if Statement- It is used to evalute a particular condition. If the condition holds true then code block is 
      executed.

      Syntax- if(condition){
           //if condition is met, code will be executed
        }
 
       Example- let num=19;
         if(num>0){
            console.log("number is positive.");
         }
   
   2. if-else Statement- If if-condition is ,it will perform some action for a specific condition.In else statement,
      there is no condition,otherwise it will executed.

      Syntax- if(condition1){
               // execute condition1 when it is true.
              }(conditon2){
                // otherwise conditon2 will execute
              }

      Example- let num=10;
            if(num%2 == 0){
                console.log("Given number is even.");
            }else{
                console.log("Given number is odd.");
            }

    3. else-if Statement- The else-if condition allows us to handling multiple possible conditions and outputs,
       
       Syntax- if(condition1){
                // if condition1 is true, it will execute
          } else if(conditon2){
               // if condition2 is true, it will execute
          }else if(condition3){
              // if condition2 is true, it will execute
          }else{
             // it will execute if above all conditions are false
          }

          Example- let num=10;
               if(num>0){
                console.log("Number is positive.");
               }else if(num<0){
                console.log("Number is negative.");
               }else{
                console.log("Number is zero");
               }
    
      4. Switch-case statement- It is used to perform different actions based on differnet conditions. The switch 
         expression is evaluated once. The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case. If 
         there is a match, the associated block of code is executed. If there is no match, the default code block
         is executed.

         Syntax- switch(expression){
                     case value1:
                         statement1;
                          break;
                     case value2:
                          statement2;
                          break;
                    .
                    .
                    .
                     case valueN:
                          statementN;
                          break;
                    default:
                         statementDefault;    
                 }

         Example-  let num=10;
         
                  switch(num){
                   case 1:
                     num= 'one';
                     break;
                      case 2:
                     num= 'two';
                     break;
                      case 3:
                     num= 'three';
                     break;
                       case 4:
                     num= 'four';
                     break;
                       case 4:
                     num= 'five';
                     break;
                     
                     default:
                     a='not found';
                     break;
                       
           }
           console.log(`The value is ${num});
